Please refer to https://updatestage.com/create-a-phaser-3-project-part-1/ for build up the enviorment, phaser and typescript.  
You need this library: `typescript-collections`. type `npm ci` in root folder to install it. (I am lazy to figure out how to use `package.json` and `package-lock.json` right now so **please use `npm ci` instead of `npm i`.** Thanks!)
